# parableradio.com

This is the code that runs parableradio.com

It leverages Amazon's Polly TTS service to turn parables into mp3 files and stream them.

To Do:
* generate a browseable list of parables on the site
* allow the list to be filtered by type (biblical, zen, other, etc)
* add play controls to the page
* add sessions to the page, so you can start back where you left off
* add randomize option
* add more free background images
* add a suggestion form

If you have any parables that you think would be good additions, email the info to me@parableradio.com
